	<h1> Header - Spotify.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/header.png">
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is large but I would have to say they are targeting mostly young adults ages of 18-35. The target audience is most lower to middle-class because the purpose of the site is to have unlimited downloads for a flat low monthly rate.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The clients goal is to get new users to sign up for there service. After they get the user to sign up the header then becomes the way of logging into there account. Their is also the option to get help if you are unable to figure out how to accomplish these tasks or are having issues. </p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>They choose to use the color green and that represents (life, nature, fertility, well being) with that being said I can relate life and well being to the site but the others fall short. The second color that the site uses is white. I must say that white and green go well together. A simple header but I like that it doesn't take away from the rest of the site because really the header is mostly for logging into an account normally.</p>

<div class="nav">

	<h1> Nav - ebay.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/nav.jpg">
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p> The target audience is very large on this site because they are targeting all age groups with money. The Nav helps connect people to the items or products they are looking for. With this being an auction site the products are ever changing so making the usability simple and easy to use is key.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client wants to help the user find products easier along with trying to catch the users eye with other products that could potentialy purchased aswell. The user is either browsing looking for items they may need or they already know what they need/want and the nav helps them get to those products faster.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>I like that the nav is the full length of the page. It is simple and will not draw people away from the purpose of the site. It gives a nice bottom-border under the in use page on the nav.</p>

<div class="cta">

	<h1> cta - uber.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/cta.png">
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is 21-45 they target people who need rides. Most of the people that I know who use uber are young adults that are going out to the bar and are being responsible. They also target drivers for their company.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client need drivers for their company along with people who need rides so that they con profit as a company because they do not have adds on their site. The user is trying to get a ride and may not have a long time to browse a site. </p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>Her eyes are looking at the site logo in the header. I like that the button is blue that means (youth, spirituality, truth, peace) and at the bottom the blue continues in the bullets used for pagination.</p>
