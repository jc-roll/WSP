    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello my name is James Roll I am currently a student at FullSail University. I was born in Orlando, Fl on August 21, 1988. I have lived in Florida most of my life until I joined the Army for five years as a paratrooper. I medically retired from the military in June of 2014 and decided to fallow my passion of computers into the next phase of my life. I enjoy the challenge of web design and development starting the program with zero prior experience. Everyday I learn something new and challenging and that is part of my drive. My family is the other half of my drive and trying to become the best I can be in order to provide a better life for them.    </p>

<div class="header">

	<h1> Header - Spotify.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/header.png">
    <a href="components/1/component1.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is large but I would have to say they are targeting mostly young adults ages of 18-35. The target audience is most lower to middle-class because the purpose of the site is to have unlimited downloads for a flat low monthly rate.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The clients goal is to get new users to sign up for there service. After they get the user to sign up the header then becomes the way of logging into there account. Their is also the option to get help if you are unable to figure out how to accomplish these tasks or are having issues. </p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>They choose to use the color green and that represents (life, nature, fertility, well being) with that being said I can relate life and well being to the site but the others fall short. The second color that the site uses is white. I must say that white and green go well together. A simple header but I like that it doesn't take away from the rest of the site because really the header is mostly for logging into an account normally.</p>

<div class="header">

	<h1> Header - Uber.com</h1>
    	<img src="img/header2.png">
     <a href="components/2/component2.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is 21-45 they target people who need rides. Most of the people that I know who use uber are young adults that are going out to the bar and are being responsible. They also target drivers for their company.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client need drivers for their company along with people who need rides so that they con profit as a company because they do not have adds on their site. The user is trying to get a ride and may not have a long time to browse a site.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>I really like how the header overlaps the cta using transparency so that the cta's impact gets even that more impact-full. The word uber is directly in the center and brands the site immediately. </p>
  
</div>

<div class="nav">

	<h1> Nav - ebay.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/nav.jpg">
     <a href="components/3/component3.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p> The target audience is very large on this site because they are targeting all age groups with money. The Nav helps connect people to the items or products they are looking for. With this being an auction site the products are ever changing so making the usability simple and easy to use is key.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client wants to help the user find products easier along with trying to catch the users eye with other products that could potentially purchased as well. The user is either browsing looking for items they may need or they already know what they need/want and the van helps them get to those products faster.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>I like that the nav is the full length of the page. It is simple and will not draw people away from the purpose of the site. It gives a nice bottom-border under the in use page on the nav.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="cta">

	<h1> cta - uber.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/cta.png">
     <a href="components/4/component4.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is 21-45 they target people who need rides. Most of the people that I know who use uber are young adults that are going out to the bar and are being responsible. They also target drivers for their company.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client need drivers for their company along with people who need rides so that they con profit as a company because they do not have adds on their site. The user is trying to get a ride and may not have a long time to browse a site. </p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>Her eyes are looking at the site logo in the header. I like that the button is blue that means (youth, spirituality, truth, peace) and at the bottom the blue continues in the bullets used for pagination.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="contact">

	<h1> Contact us - Target.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/contact.png">
     <a href="components/5/component5.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is large but I would have to say they are targeting mostly young adults ages of 18-35. The target audience is most lower to middle-class because the purpose of the site is to have unlimited downloads for a flat low monthly rate.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The User is using the contact option because they need to notify the site handlers of a problem or other issues. The Client needs to make some kind of organization of these contacts. In this case they choose to use a drop down.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>With bigger company's comes large volumes of issues, questions and involvement. Small company's might just have a contact number. Target is better off using a directory to make sure that the user is helped by the right person. </p>
  
</div>

<div class="sign">

	<h1> Sign-in - Walmart.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/SignIn.png">
     <a href="components/6/component6.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is primarily women ages 25-55. This is the location of a lot of the nations middle and lower class shopping. Because women do most of the shopping for family's I believe they would frequent this site the most.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client uses this site for product promotion and linking the users to there new products including deals and discounts. The main purpose is to increase revenue. The site tries to get the user to sign in so that way they can place them on the mailing list. The user signs in so that they can get connected people who use walmart tend to visit at least twice a month. They use the site to link themselves to the coupons as well.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>Simple is in my opinion normally best. I like how they remove adds when trying to get the user to sign in. The normal walmart site includes tons of pictures of products. By removing those product promotions and eliminating distractions and allowing the user to focus on the task at hand of actually signing up was a great choice in my opinion.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="footer">

	<h1> footer - blizzard.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/footer.png">
     <a href="components/7/component7.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is young males ages 13-24. They focus on young adults that typically do not have full time jobs and are still in school. Its harder to play video games and justify spending money on them when you have a wife and children. Because the priority's in life change. </p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client wants community outreach by creating a hype they are able to increase revenue. The main reason for this site is to disperse information about the games that Blizzard has created. The user is going to the site in hopes of information regarding the released games and upcoming games.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>The feeling of the footer is mysterious with dark blue on lighter blue. I like the logo on the left that goes with the theme of blue. Being a brand that is prevalent all over the world the ability to change the language of the site is great. The bottom boarder closes it and keeps the ability to add images or adds below. </p>
  
</div>

<div class="email">

	<h1> Mailing List - Bestbuy.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/email.png">
     <a href="components/8/component8.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is 30-50 year old males. They tend to sell techy items like flat screen TV's and other alike products. The store has sections just like most other large scale stores so yes there is the video game section that I would consider more for young adults but for the most part I believe the store is mostly for middle aged men.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client is using the mailing list to try to promote people to sign up to increase revenue. The use of blue and yellow are of course the colors of the brand and logo but bestbuy is a well know company. The user would visit this site to check prices and possibly find store locations. The only time i have gone to bestubble was to get the store's contact so that I could call in and check to see if they had the iphone I was looking for at the time.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>My favorite part of this site segment would have to be the use of yellow. The yellow highlights the key portions of this mailing list sign up. With reasoning on why they should sign up and the button being the same color they stand out way over the white text and white search box. They used this in the middle of the site and thats why it stood out to me.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="nav2">

	<h1> nav - myspace.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/nav2.png">
     <a href="components/9/component9.html"><button>View Component </button> </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site Is young adults ages 13-25. The site has evolved over the years. Back in the day's when I used this site I was in middle school and it was before facebook and my favorite thing about the site was the fact that you could customize your own page like building in css and html but in the most basic form imaginable. Unlike facebook they market more in the direction of music.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client uses community outreach because they make all of their income from adds and the amount of site traffic they have. They are competing in a small but very competitive market. Most people use some form of social media everyday. Most do not use more then one or two different kinds of social media though. The user is looking for the best social experience but even more important then that if their friends do not have an account then they will not be able to fully enjoy the site and its capabilities.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>Most navs that I have noticed do not use icons but myspace took nav's to the next level. I decided that along with my horizontal nav I should add this vertical one because depending on the site your creating it could call for either. Although the word discover is not needed and is not a responsive part of the nave it gives character and helps set the mood and intention of the site.</p>

<div class="schedule">

	<h1> schedule - AMC.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/schedule.png">
     <a href="components/10/component10.html"><button>View Component</button>  </a>
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is adults 18-55. The people who use this website are normally if not always looking for information on upcoming shows or current shows. You can live stream shows on your computer from the website. If you have cable without the guide button you may go to the site to see what is going to come on later or what has already shown along with times.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client is trying to promote their shows. Say some one tells a friend about the walking dead and that it comes on AMC they might Google the walking dead amc and if they are not impressed with the representation that the site gives them they might never actually watch the show on TV. The user is using this site for information purposes.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>I like the use of the button at the top that allows you two see earlier shows this is something that the guide button on you TV controller cannot do. The site then shows what show is on by posting it at the top of the list and placing a yellow "ON NOW" title above the time. Yellow is a great color to highlight importance on websites as long as it is not on a very light background.</p>
