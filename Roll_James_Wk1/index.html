    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello my name is James Roll im currently a student at FullSail University. I was born in Orlando, Fl on August 21, 1988. I have lived in florida most of my life untill I joined the Army for five years as a paratrooper. I medically retired from the military in June of 2014 and decided to fallow my passion of computers into the next phase of my life. I enjoy the challenge of web design and development starting the program with zero prior experience. Everyday I learn something new and challenging and that is part of my drive. My family is the other half of my drive and trying to become the best I can be in order to provide a better life for them.    </p>

<div class="header">

	<h1> Header - Spotify.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/header.png">
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is large but I would have to say they are targeting mostly young adults ages of 18-35. The target audience is most lower to middle-class because the purpose of the site is to have unlimited downloads for a flat low monthly rate.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The clients goal is to get new users to sign up for there service. After they get the user to sign up the header then becomes the way of logging into there account. Their is also the option to get help if you are unable to figure out how to accomplish these tasks or are having issues. </p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>They choose to use the color green and that represents (life, nature, fertility, well being) with that being said I can relate life and well being to the site but the others fall short. The second color that the site uses is white. I must say that white and green go well together. A simple header but I like that it doesn't take away from the rest of the site because really the header is mostly for logging into an account normally.</p>

<div class="nav">

	<h1> Nav - ebay.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/nav.jpg">
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p> The target audience is very large on this site because they are targeting all age groups with money. The Nav helps connect people to the items or products they are looking for. With this being an auction site the products are ever changing so making the usability simple and easy to use is key.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client wants to help the user find products easier along with trying to catch the users eye with other products that could potentialy purchased aswell. The user is either browsing looking for items they may need or they already know what they need/want and the nav helps them get to those products faster.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>I like that the nav is the full length of the page. It is simple and will not draw people away from the purpose of the site. It gives a nice bottom-border under the in use page on the nav.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="cta">

	<h1> cta - uber.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/cta.png">
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is 21-45 they target people who need rides. Most of the people that I know who use uber are young adults that are going out to the bar and are being responsible. They also target drivers for their company.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The client need drivers for their company along with people who need rides so that they con profit as a company because they do not have adds on their site. The user is trying to get a ride and may not have a long time to browse a site. </p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>Her eyes are looking at the site logo in the header. I like that the button is blue that means (youth, spirituality, truth, peace) and at the bottom the blue continues in the bullets used for pagination.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="contact">

	<h1> Contact us - Target.com </h1>
    	<img src="img/contact.png">
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this site is large but I would have to say they are targeting mostly young adults ages of 18-35. The target audience is most lower to middle-class because the purpose of the site is to have unlimited downloads for a flat low monthly rate.</p>
      
    <h2>Client/User Needs:</h2>
      <p>The User is using the contact option because they need to notify the site handlers of a problem or other issues. The Client needs to make some kind of organization of these contacts. In this case they choose to use a drop down.</p>
      
    <h2>Critique:</h2>
      <p>With bigger companys comes large volumes of issues, questions and envolvement. Small companys might just have a contact number. Target is better off using a directory to make sure that the user is helped by the right person. </p>
